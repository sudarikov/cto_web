            <h2>Engineering culture</h2>
            <p>We believe that engineering culture is something very important. It is also foundation which enables your business to scale up efficiently.</p>
            <p>A great culture gives you a tremendous advantage in recruiting top people, retaining those people, and subtly guiding their behavior to drive the business.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the hype, culture is not about ping pong tables, softball leagues, and free lunches. Instead, culture is the set of implicit rules, guidelines, and values that a group of people guide themselves by. It’s the peer pressure that shapes behavior in powerful ways. And simply putting a bunch of core values on a wall somewhere isn’t enough. Culture is a living thing that requires ongoing care and feeding.</p>
            <p>Nowadays it becomes even more difficult when dealing with distributed teams all around the globe. If there is no clear vision and values defined people from different countries will likely to use very different approaches to solve engineering problems and collaborate.</p>
            <p>Over 10 years, our proven team of senior leaders observed, analyzed and radically improved the culture in many companies around the world. Whilst the companies were all different, we were able to transform them into having a culture which drives performance, innovation and creativity.</p>
