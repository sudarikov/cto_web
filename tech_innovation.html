            <h2>Technology Innovation</h2>
            <p>We are at the forefront of innovative technologies, with deep knowledge and experience in creating compelling solutions for corporate-wide digital transformation programs. Working with a vast number of startups, we appreciate the out of the box thinking and the agile nature of solutions developed.</p>
            <p>We can work with you to develop an internal program to facilitate innovation through the the most important asset of your company, your people. Your employees are often closest to the issues the company is facing, and have innovative solutions in mind. External engagement with innovation is important, but more important is innovation coming form the people that commit a substantial part of their lives to the organisation. Giving them a chance to build prototypes and present solutions to management is not just smart, but also boosts morale.</p>
            <p>Also we can work with you to develop an internal innovation engagement strategy (and associated execution), where employees are given the chance to build simple business cases, given small amounts of funding to build prototypes and demonstrate their solutions to the management and the board.</p>
