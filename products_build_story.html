            <h2>The complexity Nikolay will overcome</h2>
            <p>Imagine waking up and going to work. The same route you always take, you pick up a coffee from the lady who may even know your name by now, say “Hi” to the security guard and sit at your familiar desk.</p>
            <p>First job of the morning is a cigarette on the balcony with Pavel, Alex and Olga. You have tell the same jokes, talk about the local news and what was on TV last night. Pavel is looking forward to speaking to Yong Kwan Chun - it’s the first day they are working with a new client from South Korea.</p>
            <p>Then you have a standup - desire quickly gives way to concern as nobody knows what the dude is saying because his accent is strong. Worse still, he doesn’t understand them either. The whole thing is more complex than it needed to be and neither side feels comfortable with the outcome.</p>
            <p>Yong Kwan Chun closes the Google Hangout at the end of the meeting. I shouldn’t have used the team in Kiev he thinks, but what was the alternative? Surely Kiev is one of the best outsourcing destinations? Should I have paid 3x the price to use Accenture instead? For what? Better communication?</p>
            <p>The Kiev team feel confused. On the one hand, they really want to impress their new client. But which one of them can reach out and bridge the clear gaps between the two sides. Does this mean that we can’t work with South Koreans? Or the whole of Asia? The team will give it a few weeks and see if it improves. If it doesn’t, it’s likely that the team will consider other options and with a heavy heart, take another role or wait for the client to look for an alternative.</p>
            <p>This is a story that happens all the time with new experiences in distributed teams. So, do we all need to use a large consultancy to solve the problem? Is it really worth 3x to do that?</p>
            <p>Communication, shared goals and values, and an experienced manager are required to keep the nearshore team motivated, focused and aligned with the client goals. For the client, it saves needless teething pain. For the team, it provides motivation and alignment - which is a real competitive advantage to everyone.</p>
