            <h2>Technology Audit</h2>
            <p>Are you struggling with your current tech with implementation taking too long, or being too buggy? Are you struggling with the current team or perhaps are unsure if your current tech stack can see you to the next phase of growth? Or, are you simply going for raising funds and want to be sure where you stand on the technology and how investors are likely to view it?</p>
            <p>As part of our Technology Audit we will review your infrastructure, architecture, code, development practices, testing methodologies, security and tools; along with related people and processes. We will also capture your vision for the future and analyse the suitability of current technology and infrastructure stacks in place. The final audit report, which is separate to the requirements report, will explain the current system, highlight potential issues and suggest solutions and future architecture and technologies that should be used to achieve your business goals.</p>
