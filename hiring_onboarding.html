            <h2>Hiring and on-boarding</h2>
            <p>For startups and fast growing companies, getting the cultural or skills bit wrong can spell the end for them. No one is better at determining cultural fit than you but when it comes to skills, many startups struggle to identify if an interview candidate has the required technical skills to deliver the next stage of their product, let alone their overall vision.</p>
            <p>We have helped numerous startups validate the technical capability of candidates for positions ranging from senior developer to CTOs. We are often engaged after initial interviews i.e. after the shortlist is completed and it’s time to validate technical capabilities. We help determine if candidates understand the technology stack required for the product and their familiarity with rapid iterative development methodologies.</p>
            <p>The difference in value of a great engineer versus an average one is massive. When brought in, some engineers can be 10 times more effective than other engineers based sheerly on how they handle their role, making a major difference in the experiences and products a company creates. We know what are the qualities to look at during interview, so we can save you a lot of time, efforts and budget on hiring.</p>
            <p>Certainly, we can go further and work together with you to define how your perfect team should look like, what skills they need and then source people who will be a great fit.</p>
            <p>The value of on-boarding, while sometimes underestimated, is very high. This defines how quickly you can get return on investment for every engineer working for you and generates loyalty early when organized properly.</p>
            <p>So why not to reuse our extensive experience in this area too?</p>
