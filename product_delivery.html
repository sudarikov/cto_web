            <h2>Product delivery</h2>
            <p>In any startup, speed is of the essence without a compromise on quality. Scalability and flexibility are of paramount concern as the product vision itself is quickly iterating. We work closely with you to understand your vision, strategic and tactical goals to deliver the technology solution you want.</p>
            <p>We will turn your vision into working software products and services - whether that's an app, website or full platform. Our methodology is aimed to deliver results fast and then continuously improve after launch. This significantly improves time-to-market and allow to adopt your product to customer needs earlier - maximising your business performance.</p>
            <p>Already have a team, but need to go even faster? We can empower your existing team bringing our best engineers onboard. They will organically extend your team exactly for the time you need.Then they will gradually disengage while handing over specific parts of the product to your core team. They will be available for part-time support anytime later if you need them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you need to disrupt the whole industry in order to make a next step that gives you significant competitive advantage. This can be tricky when your core team is constantly busy with improving the product and listening to customer needs. We have lots of experience building purely innovative products from the idea to production using marketing research, data analytics, A/B testing and user interviews.</p>
            <p>Modern technologies like Big Data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) bring almost endless possibilities to win over competitors, doesn't matter how big they are or what industry you are in. However, this requires advanced technology skills and very open creative culture which is sometimes not easy to build. We can create prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) for you and then develop it further or pass it onto your own team.</p>
