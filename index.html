        <h3>WHY YOU NEED CTO AS A SERVICE</h3>
        <p>A Chief Technology Officer sets the tech strategy for a large organisation, and while small to medium entities can’t justify the cost of one, they certainly have the need. This is especially so when you’re just starting out or about to make a major change or investment.</p>
        <p>We give you <a href="cto_as_a_service.html">on-demand strategic IT advice</a> for the short and long term, giving you the knowledge and decision-making capabilities of a large business but at a fraction of the cost of having a permanent CTO role in house or signing up to an IT enterprise firm.</p>
        <p>Startups develop in paths different from conventional companies. On startup’s life journey things change again and again. We have designed development strategies specific for startups based on the factors most important for them: reduced time-to-market, ability to quickly respond to changes, high focus on quality, using mainstream technologies. By following this strategy, we have led many of startups from their first step to a profitable business.</p>
        <p>The next challenge is to scale your technology business. This requires strong foundation which includes: engineering culture, mature delivery processes and operational excellence. But there are certainly a lot of other dimensions to consider - growth strategy, <a href="hiring_onboarding.html">hiring</a>, infrastructure cost and <a href="tech_innovation.html">innovation</a>. We've been on the journey together with some very fast-growing companies and know what it takes to make <a href="product_delivery.html">rapid confident change</a>.</p>
        <p>And even if you're big and successful company you still might need to <a href="cto_as_a_service.html">delegate some aspects of CTO job</a> in order to move faster. We can help with <a href="tech_audit.html">independent technology audit</a>, hiring, engineering culture debugging and <a href="tech_due_diligence.html">technology due diligence</a>. Also, we can be extension to your engineering team or take responsibility for en-to-end delivery of specific project.</p>
